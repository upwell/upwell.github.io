## Move faster : EasyMotion

EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes  
the `<number>` out of `<number>w` or `<number>f{char}` by highlighting all  
possible choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the  
target.

The command is triggered by a leader key. The default is `<leader><leader>`.

`<leader><leader>w` would highlight all choices with `<a-z><0-9>`.  
`<leader><leader>f`  
`<leader><leader>f{char}`

## Repeats

Single repeats

`.` : used to repeat simple changes  
`@:` : used to repeat last command-line

## Surround

With plugin [Surround][1], you can easily handle surround with words.

### Add surroundings

`ys` takes an **valid Vim motion** or text object as the first object and wraps it using the second
argument.
```
  Old text                  Command     New text
  Hello w*orld!             ysiw)       Hello (world)!
```

Under **visual mode**, select content and press `S` with the surrounding wound wrap the selected
content.

### Delete surroundings

Delete surroundings is `ds` .
```
  Old text                  Command     New text ~
  "Hello *world!"           ds"         Hello world!
  (123+4*56)/2              ds)         123+456/2
  <div>Yo!*</div>           dst         Yo!
```
