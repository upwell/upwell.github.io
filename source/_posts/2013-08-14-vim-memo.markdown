## EasyMotion - move faster

EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes  
the `<number>` out of `<number>w` or `<number>f{char}` by highlighting all  
possible choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the  
target.

The command is triggered by a leader key. The default is `<leader><leader>`.

`<leader><leader>w` would highlight all choices with `<a-z><0-9>`.  
`<leader><leader>f`  
`<leader><leader>f{char}`
